    <h3>FAQ's</h3>

    <p class="ques">1. How long does it take to process the return?</p>
    <p>Please allow up to two weeks from the date you mail your item(s) back for your return to be processed—you will receive an email confirmation when complete. If you are returning items from multiple orders in the same package, you must start a return here for each order and include all return packing slips for each order in your package. Returns missing packing slips will result in up to an additional week of processing time.</p>

    <p class="ques">2. How long does it take to receive my refund?</p>
    <p>Once you receive your email indicating your return has been processed, you can expect to receive your credit in 3-5 business days.</p>

    <p class="ques">3. Do you offer price adjustments?</p>
    <p>We gladly honor a one-time price adjustment on full-price merchandise within seven days of the retail purchase or mail-order ship date if accompanied by the original receipt. Items not purchased at full price are ineligible for price adjustments. Orders already placed with a coupon or promotion are also ineligible for additional discounts</p>

    <p class="ques">4. How do I return items delivered by a Marketplace vendor?</p>
    <p>Items delivered by our Marketplace vendors must be returned directly to them and will not be accepted at J.Crew stores or the distribution center. To return your items, please follow the instructions enclosed in your package. You will receive a confirmation email once the Marketplace vendor has received your package and a refund has been processed.</p>

    <p class="ques">5. Is there is a return fee?</p>
    <p>If you use our pre-paid return label, the cost of return shipping is $7.50 for any number of items and will be deducted from your refund. You may also choose to mail the item back using your own insured, traceable method.</p>

    <p class="ques">6. Can I return a J.Crew item to a J.Crew Factory store (and vice versa)?</p>
    <p>No—items can only be returned to the brand from which they were purchased.</p>

    <p class="ques">7. How do I request a return label?</p>
    <p>Start your return process here to receive a return label.</p>

    <p class="ques">8. Can I return my items to a store?</p>
    <p>Online and phone purchases, including orders placed in stores for delivery, that shipped to a U.S. address may be returned to any J.Crew store in the United States.</p>

    <p class="ques">9. Can I return my store purchase through the mail?</p>
    <p>Yes. Returns can be processed by mail for items purchased in our retail stores within 30 days of original purchase. Please contact us for the appropriate mailing address and include a copy of your receipt in your return package.</p>

    <p class="ques">10. How do I make an exchange?</p>
