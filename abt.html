   <div> <h2>CLASSIC WITH A TWIST AND STYLE YOU CAN TRUST</h2>
    <P>We make timeless clothes that last a lifetime...then pair them 
        with of-the-moment styles season after seasons, decade after decade. <b>We think that distinct heritage pairs perfectly with modern design and fabric technology. we believe in feel good color...</b>
      Even if black or navy makes you feel best, we're here for that.
    <b>We're the experts in signature categories: cashmere, coats,blazers,pants-and we also collaborate with the coolest brands out there</b>
 because we know that creativity is contagious. we consider leopard a neutral, speak stripes fluently and live for a great gingham. We 
beleive in <i>looking</i>lke a millon bucks, not spending it-which is why we go the extra mile to source the absolute best
fabrics at the most accessible pricees. We also know that we have a responsibility to the planet and to humanity to choose eco-friendly faabrics and to support our factory workers, without compromise.
We've had your back for over 35 years,and we're convinced there's no better expert on our clothes than you, our customer.</P>
